## Introduction

Once upon a time there was a legendary site called VXHeaven. 
It was one of the largest computer virus websites. 
The author of the site hosted a gigantic collection of computer viruses and conveniently sorted it out. 
Unfortunately, after 2017, the site ceased to exist. 
But there was an archive with an almost complete collection of VXHeaven malware. 
Truthly, in Internet a lot of sites providing malware datasets. Some of these sites are paid
some of these sites are requiring registration/invintation which so hard to get,
some site requiring from you some publications to gain access to the. So I decided to create
my own malware repository where everyone can download any sample for free
without headache.

The main goal of this project is to provide contributable and downloadable malware database
for research and analysis purposes. Make the malware more simply to get.
Also I thought that it would be great to write convenient and understandable wiki
(which will be ready someday) to learn about a specific sample from this collection
and help you understand all nature of computer viruses.

## Contents

* DOS Malware
* Windows (Win16, Win32, Win9x) Malware
* Boot Sector Corruption Malware
* BATCH, VBS Malware
* UNIX Malware (Yes, it actually exists)
* Web Malware (HTML, JS)
* Exotic Malware
* Other Malware 


## Getting started

It's not recommended to run malware on real machine, so get an emulators.

* [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) or [DOSEMU](http://www.dosemu.org/stable/) for running DOS viruses
* [PCem](https://pcem-emulator.co.uk/downloads.html) or [86box](http://ci.86box.net/job/86Box/) for running older operating systems on older hardware (this emulators require roms, get them from here [for 86box](https://github.com/86Box/roms) or here [for PCem](https://github.com/BaRRaKudaRain/PCem-ROMs))
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/) or [BOCHS](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/getcurrent.html) if you want flexible emulator
* If you want modern and easy emulator, use VMware or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Install operating system such as Windows or UNIX like or other type of software needed to run the virus.
Now run it and enjoy its payloads.
